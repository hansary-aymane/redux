------------------ Redux ------------------

> Redux : state management library
	> Centralizes application's state
	> Makes data flow transparent and predictable

> In functional programming : 
	> Higher order functions (is a function takes a function as an argument || returns it || both)

// STORE => GLOBALIZED STATE

// ACTION INCREMENT => Function that returns an object

// REDUCER => Gonna take care of all the actions

// DISPATCH => The fundamental method of updating a Redux store's state

> combineReducers : we use it if we have more than one reducer
